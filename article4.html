                  Luke Chiang is fast becoming a prominent name in the indie-pop industry renowned for his emotional music that profoundly touches fans.

                  The start of Luke’s path to music can be traced back to his college hostel room where he would post covers and original songs on YouTube. Within an instant, he began gaining recognition for songs that were sincere and full of raw emotion. As such, other songs like "Shouldn’t Be" and "Best Part" continued to build up his fan base especially amongst young people who could relate to themes of romance, vulnerability and self-discovery.

                  Chiang does minimalist production on most of his music so that there is only space left for his vocals. Most times you will hear light guitar melodies, subtle beats or harmonies layered perfectly creating a very soft almost meditative effect. This simplicity coupled with profound lyrics gives his work timeless appeal transcending various kinds of fan bases.
