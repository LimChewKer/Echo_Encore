                  “Born this way” is unarguably a song that has the power to strengthen a person’s sense of uniqueness and self-acceptance. Ever since its release in 2011, it has risen and emphasised the message for people to accept that they are just as perfect as they are, embracing love regardless of race, sexuality, or gender.
